**I developed a **real-time style chat application** locally using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** in **Visual Studio Code**, previewing it through the **Live Server** extension for instant updates while coding. The interface features a responsive design with a sidebar for online users, a main chat area with scrollable message history, a typing indicator, and a message input bar with emoji support. I implemented JavaScript logic to handle sending messages, appending them dynamically to the chat window, and simulating real-time interactions with auto-generated responses and a typing animation for realism. Styling was done using custom CSS with Flexbox for layout, gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and media queries for mobile responsiveness. For references, I used **MDN Web Docs** for DOM manipulation methods, CSS animations, and event handling, as well as **Google Fonts and emoji resources** for visual enhancement. The structure, functionality, and styling were coded by me based on my understanding, while online resources served only as guidance for syntax and design ideas. The result is a clean, responsive, and interactive chat interface that mimics real-time messaging with message history and engaging UI effects.**
